## Course topics

Gain experience in data collection, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, statistical inference and Bayesian statistics while working on problems and case studies inspired by and based on real-world questions. 

The course will focus on the Python programming language.

---

## Learning objectives

By the end of the semester, you will be able to...

-   obtain, explore, visualize, and analyze data in Python to investigate patterns.
-   fit and evaluate regression and classification models to make predictions.
-   use resampling methods to obtain reliable predictions.
-   perform simulation-based inference using randomization and bootstrapping.
-   use statistical methods to test hypothesis.
-   apply Bayes' theorem, the foundation of Bayesian statistics.

## Where to get help

- If you have a question during lecture, feel free to ask it! 
- Outside of class, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the [Moodle course forum](https://e-learning.hdm-stuttgart.de/moodle/mod/forum/view.php?id=266446).
- Emails should be reserved for questions not appropriate for the public forum. **If you email me, please include the name of our course in the subject line.**

## Lectures

A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing.
Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture.

You are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.

---

## Assessment

Assessment for the course is comprised of four components: 

- [application exercises](application-exercises)
- [homework assignments](hw) 
- [exams](exams)
- [project](project)

---

(application-exercises)=
### Application exercises

Parts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on "Application Exercises" (AE). These small exercises will give you an opportunity to practice apply the concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. 

AEs should be completed and **submitted individually**.


---

(hw)=
### Homework

In homeworks (HW), you will apply what you've learned during lectures to complete data analysis and visualization‚ tasks using data not covered during lectures.

You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and **submitted individually**.

Homework must be completed in the provided Jupyter Notebooks in your course GitHub-repo and also submitted in Moodle.

---

(exams)=
### Exams

There will be multiple open-note exams in Moodle.
Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you've learned in the course thus far.


:::{Note}
The exams will focus on the conceptual understanding of the content
:::

More details about the exams will be given during the semester.


---


(project)=
### Project

The purpose of the [project](project-description.md) is to apply what you've learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting, data-driven research question. The project will be completed in **teams**.

More information about the project will be provided during the semester.

---

## Grading


The final course grade will be calculated as follows:

| Category              | Percentage      |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Application exercises | 10%             |
| Homework              | 20%             |
| Project               | 30%             |
| Exams                 | 40%             |


The final grade will be determined based on the following thresholds:

|  Grade       | Final Course Grade |
|--------------|--------------------|
| 1.0           | 96 - 100          |
| 1.3           | 91 - 95           |
| 1.7           | 85 - 90           |
| 2.0           | 80 - 84           |
| 2.3           | 75 - 79           |
| 2.7           | 70 - 74           |
| 3.0           | 65 - 69           |
| 3.3           | 60 - 64           |
| 3.7           | 55 - 59           |
| 4.0            | 50 - 54          |
| 4.7           | 15 - 49           |
| 5.0            | 0 - 14           |
